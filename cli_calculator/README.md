## Overview

Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. This project implements a simple tool that calculates your net income by subtracting expenses from your total income. Upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.

- **HashMap**: Utilizes the `HashMap` class to store item names and their respective earnings.
- **Iterating Over Collections**: Demonstrates iteration over a `HashMap` using `forEach` and `for` loop.
- **Scanner**: Uses the `Scanner` class to read user input for staff and other expenses.
- **Data Types**: Demonstrates the use of various data types, including `String`, `Double`, and `double`.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs arithmetic operations to calculate the total income and net income.
- **Printing Output**: Uses `System.out.println` to display information to the console.
