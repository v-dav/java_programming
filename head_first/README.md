# Beer Song, Guessing Game and PhrasOMatic

This repository contains three different Java projects, each showcasing fundamental concepts of Java programming. Below are the descriptions and usage instructions for each project.
1.	**Beer Song:** Demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, and string manipulation.
2.	**Guess Game:** Showcases object-oriented programming principles by defining classes, creating instances, and using methods. It also incorporates random number generation and basic game logic.
3.	**PhraseOMatic:** Illustrates array handling, random number generation, and string concatenation to generate random phrases.

## Projects

### 1. Beer Song

This project prints the lyrics to the classic "99 Bottles of Beer" song. It starts from 99 bottles and counts down to 1, printing appropriate lines for each number of bottles.

### 2. Guess Game

This project implements a simple number-guessing game. The game generates a random number between 0 and 9, and three players attempt to guess the number. The game continues until one of the players guesses the number correctly.

### 3. PhraseOMatic

This project generates a random phrase by selecting words from three different lists and combining them. The result is a phrase that can be used as a business jargon or a buzzword.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Programs**:
    ```bash
    javac BeerSong.java
    javac GuessingGameLauncher.java
    javac PhraseOMatic.java
    ```

2. **Run the Programs**:
