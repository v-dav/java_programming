## Overview

This project implements a simple mortgage calculator in Java. The program prompts the user to enter the principal amount, annual interest rate, and period in years. It then calculates the monthly mortgage payment and displays it in a formatted currency representation.

## Concepts Implemented

- **Variables and Constants**: Use of final variables for constants like `MONTHS_IN_YEAR` and `PERCENTAGE`.
- **User Input**: Utilizes the `Scanner` class to gather user input from the console.
- **Data Types**: Demonstrates the use of various data types, including `int`, `float`, `byte`, and `double`.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs arithmetic operations to calculate the monthly interest rate and mortgage payment.
- **Math Library**: Uses the `Math` class for power calculations.
- **Number Formatting**: Formats the mortgage payment as currency using the `NumberFormat` class.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the principal amount when prompted.
3. Enter the annual interest rate when prompted.
4. Enter the period in years when prompted.
5. The program will calculate and display the monthly mortgage payment.

Example:
```
Principal: 100000
Annual Interest Rate: 5
Period (Years): 30
Mortgage: $536.82
```
