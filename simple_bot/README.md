## Project Description

SimpleBot is a basic interactive console application written in Java. It acts as a friendly bot that interacts with the user, guesses their age using mathematical operations, counts to a user-specified number, and quizzes the user on programming knowledge. This project serves as an introductory example of working with basic Java syntax, control structures, and user input.

## Features

- **Greet the User**: Introduces itself and asks for the user's name.
- **Guess Age**: Asks for remainders when the user's age is divided by 3, 5, and 7, then calculates and displays the age.
- **Count to a Number**: Counts from 0 to a user-specified number.
- **Quiz**: Asks a simple programming question and validates the user's answer.
- **Friendly Farewell**: Ends the interaction with a congratulatory message.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Compile the Program**:
    ```bash
    javac SimpleBot.java
    ```

2. **Run the Program**:
    ```bash
    java SimpleBot
    ```

3. **Follow the On-Screen Prompts**:
    - Enter your name when prompted.
    - Provide the remainders of your age divided by 3, 5, and 7.
    - Enter a number to count to.
    - Answer the programming quiz question.

### Example Interaction

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2024.
Please, remind me your name.
John
What a great name you have, John!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
1

1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
5
0!
1!
2!
3!
4!
5!
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.

Congratulations, have a nice day!
