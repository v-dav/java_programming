## 🧐 Description
Welcome to my Java learning repository! Here, I document my journey of learning Java through various personal projects, from very small to big.


Java is a versatile and robust programming language renowned for its **compiled** nature, which ensures that Java code is transformed into **bytecode**, allowing it to run efficiently on **any platform** equipped with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. 

Embracing the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, Java promotes modular and reusable code through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

One of Java's standout features is its **platform independence**, exemplified by the **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy**. This attribute stems from the portability of Java bytecode, enabling Java applications to seamlessly execute on diverse systems without modification. 

As a **high-level language**, Java simplifies complex tasks, offering a comprehensive standard library and **automatic memory management**, reducing the risk of memory-related errors. Its class-based structure fosters a structured and organized codebase, enhancing readability and maintainability. 

With its commitment to security, performance, and portability, Java has become a go-to choice for developing a wide range of applications, from **web and mobile to enterprise-level systems.**

## 🍰 Learning Objectives

By working on these projects, I aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understand the basics of Java programming.
- Gain proficiency in Java.
- Apply object-oriented principles in real-world scenarios.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

The repository uses the following dependencies:

- [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) - Version 11.0.21

##  🧑🏻‍💻 Setup

To run these projects, ensure you have Java installed:

```bash
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install default-jdk
```

```bash
root@ea41b7dd36c8:~# java -version
openjdk version "11.0.21" 2023-10-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.21+9-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.21+9-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04, mixed mode)
```

If the version matches, you're good to go!
